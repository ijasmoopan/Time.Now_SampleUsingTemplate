# Time.Now
My first project..

When I Starting my first project, I decided to complete the project with html templates. Then I started my project with 2 templates, which is one for user side and another one for admin side. After completing user management and product management I felt somany mistakes... Not really mistakes...I felt miscomfort for using templates. Then I decided to change my entire project in template to React. Then I am dropping my first project using template now. 

The main reason of dropping the project by using was I dont create REST APIs. So I thought why I am creating a project like that....

Now onwards I start my first project with React..It will be in another repository..

Again I named it as Time.Now.

Thank you for reading...
